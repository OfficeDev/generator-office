## Reporting Bugs & Issues
If you have any bugs or issues with the generator. Please submit them in the [Issues](/OfficeDev/generator-office/issues) for this repo.

## Submitting Feature Requests & Design Change Requests
Feature requests and Design Change Requests (DCRs) are an important part of the lifecycle of any software project. Please log these as [Issues](/OfficeDev/generator-office/issues) in the repo. 

When opening any feature requests, consider including as much information as possible, including: 

- Detailed scenarios enabled by the feature or DCR.
- Information about your use case or additional value your business or site will see from the feature.
- Any design tips or estimation ideas you may have considered already.
- Make note of whether you are opening an issue you would like the Microsoft team or another community member to work on or if you are looking to design & develop the feature yourself.
- Any potential caveats or concerns you may have already thought about.
- A miniature test plan or list of test scenarios is always helpful.

## Contributing Code
As you can see from this repo, we are using unit tests to test the generator.  We will only accept pull requests that have full unit test coverage & conform to the coding style guides.

Please feel free to reach out to the team if you have any questions on contributing. You can create an issue if you are having problems and @ mention [@jthake](/jthake) & [@andrewconnell](/andrewconnell).

## Submitting Pull Requests
