# Microsoft Office Add-in Project Generator - YO OFFICE!

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-office.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-office)
[![Downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/generator-office.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/generator-office)
[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/generator-office.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/generator-office)

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for creating [Microsoft Office Add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) projects using any text editor. Microsoft includes fantastic & [rich development tools for creating Office related projects using Visual Studio 2013](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2013) or [tools for Visual Studio 2015](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2015). This generator is for those developers who:

- use an editor other than Visual Studio (we love Visual Studio Code)
- are interested in using a technology other than plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript

> If you are building an Angular or React add-in and would like to learn more about using Yo Office specifically for those frameworks, see [Build an Add-in with React](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-get-started-react) or [Build an Add-in with Angular](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-get-started-angular).

Like other Yeoman generators, this simply creates the scaffolding of files for your Office Add-in project. It allows you to create add-ins for:

- Excel
- OneNote
- Outlook
- PowerPoint
- Project
- Word
- Excel Custom Functions (Preview: Requires the Insider channel for Excel)

Choose to create Office Add-in projects using plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript (*mirroring the same projects that Visual Studio creates*) or create Angular-based projects.

## Install

> **Important:** If this is the first time you're using Yeoman or installing a Yeoman generator, first install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 8.0.0 or later). For developers on Mac, we recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install Node.js with the right permissions. When the installation completes, restart your console (or if you are using Windows, restart your machine) to ensure you use the updated system environment variables.

Install `yo` (Yeoman) and `generator-office` globally using NPM.

```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-office
```

## Usage

```bash
$ yo office [arguments] [options]
```

### Command Line Arguments
The following command line arguments are supported. If using the command line arguments, you must use them in the order cited below, or the generator will prompt you for the values.

#### `projectType`
Specifies the project type to create. 

Project Type | Description
----------- | ------------------------
taskpane | Task Pane add-in using HTML
angular | Task Pane add-in using the Angular framework
react | Task Pane add-in using the React framework
excel-functions | Task Pane add-in with Excel Custom Functions
manifest | Manifest and related files for an Office Add-in
  - Type: String
  - Optional

#### `name`
Title of the project - this is the display name that is written the manifest.xml file.
  - Type: String
  - Optional
 
>**Note:** The Windows command prompt requires this argument to be in quotes (e.g. "My Office Add-in")

#### `host`
The Microsoft Office client application that can host the add-in. The supported arguments include Excel (`excel`), OneNote (`onenote`), Outlook (`outlook`), PowerPoint (`powerpoint`), Project (`project`), and Word (`word`).
  - Type: String
  - Optional

### Command Line Options
The following command line options are supported. If these are not specified, the generator will prompt you for the values before scaffolding the project.  The options should be specified after the projectType, name and host arguments.

Specifying `--output` tells the generator to create the project in a specific location.  If the output parameter is not specified, the project will be created in the current directory. If the output option specifies a non-empty folder,
the generator will inform you so you don't accidentally overwrite existing files.

  - Type: String
  - Optional

Specifying `--js` tells the generator to use JavaScript.

  - Type: Boolean
  - Default: False
  - Optional

  Specifying `--ts` tells the generator to use TypeScript.

  - Type: Boolean
  - Default: False
  - Optional

    Specifying `--details` tells the generator to provide detailed help, including all the accepted values for each project type and host,

  - Type: Boolean
  - Default: False
  - Optional

#### `--skip-install`

After scaffolding the project, the generator (and all sub generators) run all package management install commands such as `npm install` & `typings install`. Specifying `--skip-install` tells the generator to skip this step.

  - Type: Boolean
  - Default: False
  - Optional

## Running the Generated Site

Launch the local HTTPS site on `https://localhost:3000` by simply typing the following command in your console:

```bash
$ npm start
```

> **Note**: Office Add-ins should use HTTPS, not HTTP, even when you are developing. If you are prompted to install a certificate after you run `npm start`, accept the prompt to install the certificate that the Yeoman generator provides. For more information about enabling HTTPS for your add-in, see [Installing the self-signed certificate](src/docs/ssl.md).

Browse to the 'External' IP address listed in your console to test your web app across multiple browsers and devices that are connected on your local network.

## Validate manifest.xml

As you modify your `manifest.xml` file, use the included [Office Toolbox](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-toolbox) to ensure that your XML file is correct and complete. It will also give you information on against what platforms to test your add-ins before submitting to the store.

To run Office Add-in Validator, use the following command in your project directory:
```bash
$ npm run validate
```

For more information on manifest validation, refer to our [add-in manifests documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/add-in-manifests).
