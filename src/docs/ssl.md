# Adding Self-Signed Certificates as Trusted Root Certificate

Office clients require add-ins and webpages to come from a trusted and secure location. This generator leverages openssl to start a web server, which requires a self-signed certificate. Your workstation will not trust this certificate and thus, the Office client, in which you are running your Office Add-in, will not load your add-in.

When you browse to a site that has an untrusted certificate, the browser will display an error with the certificate:

To fix this, you need to configure your developer workstation to trust the self-signed certificate. The steps for this differ depending on your developer environment (OSX / Windows / Linux). Use these instructions to trust the certificate:

   1. Click the plus button at the bottom and select the **localhost.cer** file you copied to the desktop.
   1. In the dialog that comes up, click **Always Trust**.
   1. After **localhost** gets added to the **System** keychain, double-click it to open it again.
   1. Expand the **Trust** section and for the first option, pick **Always Trust**.

At this point everything has been configured. Quit all browsers, then reopen and try to navigate to the local HTTPS site. The browser should report it as a valid certificate:

## [Windows](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754841.aspx)

Take the following steps to setup the certificate authority cert for localhost:

1.	Go to {project root}\certs.
2.	Double-click ca.crt, and select **Install Certificate**.
